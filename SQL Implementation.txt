select First_name,Last_name,Recipient_id 
from recipient
where Recipient_blood_group='A+';

#2. find out the Donors (first name,last name, Donor id) whose weight lies between 50 and 90 (Simple Queries)
Select First_name,Last_name,donor_id
from Donor
where weight
between 50 and 90;

#3. Find out the number of locations, where Blood donation events are conducted in Schools (Queries with Aggregate Functions)

from Events
where Event_type='School';

#4. Calculate the variance in Haemoglobin level and the Iron level of samples which are deemed Good (Queries with Aggregate Functions)
select Quality, variance(Haemoglobin_level) as Haemoglobin_level_variance, avg(Iron_level) as Average_iron_level
from analysis
where Quality='Good';

#5. Find the Blood Bank Names and the Amount of Blood (of different blood groups) they have in stock (Queries with Group By, JOINS)
select b.bloodbank_name,sum(s.Blood_available) as Total_quantity_available,s.Blood_group
from Bloodbanks b Inner JOIN stocks s
